Description 
***********

This program will show you a pong like screen, it's not a game because there's no
AI and there's no score counting and only the player1 works. And i think, i'll not go further with this program (except if there's a interest).

In fact, the aim of this program is to show how to setup and display sprites with the
genesis in Asm (in my case SegaAsm from Charles Doty).

This pretty tiny rom is my first attempt to program the megadrive/genesis, it's also my first program in assembler so the code must be pretty weird.

Compatibility
*************

Tried with my P3 450.

works with the latest version of Dgen, Genecyst, Megasis, Gens and Kgen
run slowly on the last Generator32 beta (8 march 2000). 

Don't have tried with a real genesis,Mess and Vgen.
