====================================================================================
Just me poking around Pascal Bosquet's code to get this running in GNU Assembly (GAS).  I'm
currently learning the M68000 and Mega Drive/Genesis programming, this code just took
a bit figuring out how the header should look like and getting the makefile just right.
Don't see a lot of newer examples online using GAS, figured someone else other than me
would like to see this as well so I'll put whatever I get compiled on Github.
   
If you don't have a tool chain installed you can install binutils using [my tools setup][1] 
or use the SGDK's toolchain [SGDK toolchain] [2].  If you are using the SGDK toolchain, just
modify the GENDEV variable in my makefile to conform to your setup.
